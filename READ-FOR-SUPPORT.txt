Alright, looks like you're interested in using the A.I., so I'm going to cover the basics on what you need in order for your bot to thrive.

Requirements:
  - An Alternate Dicord Account. Discord Selfbots are against T.O.S., if you get caught don't let your main account get screwed over.
  - Your chosen Discord Accounts user token. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqSSXwcL7o0
  - Node.js. https://nodejs.org/en/download/
  - Discord.js VERSION 11.4.2. (npm install discord.js@11.4.2 in terminal/command prompt).
  
  
Once you've set everything up, download the bots files and input your token into the code (the option to do this should be at the very top).
BEAR IN MIND. DISCORD.JS VERSION 11.4.2 IS THE LAST DISCORD.JS VERSION TO SUPPORT SELFBOTS, ANY NEWER VERSION WILL NOT WORK. YOU MUST TYPE npm install discord.js@11.4.2 IF YOU WANT YOUR BOT TO WORK.
